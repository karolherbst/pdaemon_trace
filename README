# PDAEMON_Trace

This toolset is meant to allow tracing the reclocking policy of pdaemon/pmu
on NVIDIA Kepler GPUs.

The modification to Nouveau is minimal and I would advise using a more
up-to-date version of nouveau, found at
http://cgit.freedesktop.org/~darktama/nouveau The patch that should be applied
on top of it can be found in the nouveau/folder (0001-just-dump-the-clocks.patch).

Concerning pwr_read, if you do not have an ina3221, you may have to tweak the
code to make it compatible with the traces for other power sensors. Luckily
for you, the ina219's code is already there and will tell you how you to handle
it.

Have fun tracing the blob!
